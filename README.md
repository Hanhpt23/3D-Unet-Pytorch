# Volumetric segmentation using Unet 3D
- Volumetric segmentation allows for a detailed analysis of anatomical structures, facilitating more personalized and precise treatment plans. This is especially critical in fields like oncology where understanding the exact location and size of tumors is essential.

- Similar to Unet 2D, we can develop Unet 3D by using a set of 3D networks like Conv3d, Maxpooling 3D, BatchNorm3d.

In this repository, Unet 3D is implemented using Pytorch and Unet 2D.
